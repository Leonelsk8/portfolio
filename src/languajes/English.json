That is why I took a Full Stack programming course at Rolling Code School where I got certified. I already had some experience with C++, Java, HeidiSQL, MariaDB, Haskell, among others, thanks to Engineering, where I started practicing my logic with flowcharts. Then at Rolling Code I was in an intensive development bootcamp web, doing group projects in each module using the scrum methodology and the trello board to maintain the organization of the team and the project in a professional manner. They prepared us in a work environment and with the latest technologies used today.",
